# 3D_Medical
This repository is for working with 3D models for Medical imaging.

3D_model.ipynb contains codes for creating a 3D visualization model of the vertebral column from CT scans.
The solution was developed based on the methods proposed by https://www.raddq.com/dicom-processing-segmentation-visualization-in-python/ and https://www.kaggle.com/asura93/full-preprocessing-tutorial.

The scripts can be run in the Jupiter notebook.
